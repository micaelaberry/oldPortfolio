						Hello! I'm Micaela and I am an aspiring full-stack developer. I have a Bachelor's Degree from Ohio University and I currently attend an intense software development bootcamp to enhance my programing knowledge and skills. In my previous position, I worked as a Graphic Designer where I implemented marketing and web strategies. I found myself entralled in the web application side of of my responsibilities which led me to explore the technical side of the design field. I'm excited to take the experience, knowledge, and skills I have gained and use them in a professional setting. I look forward to problem solving and implementing new and creative ideas. Contact Me <a href="#ContactMe"> here!</a>

							<br></br>
							<li>Java, Spring, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Responsive design / Mobile, Structured Query Language (SQL), Transactional Databases/MSSQL, Object Oriented, and Source Control / Git. </li>

									Our virtual pets at the shelter have run amok! But no worries because the Doctor is here and he is here to help. The theme of this project was Doctor Who and all the pets are the companions. This app has multiple classes where methods are called upon to feed, water, oil, walk, and clean the cages of our pets. We have not only organic pets but robotic pets as well. Allons-y! The IDE used for this project was Eclipse and the Java skills required were:
									<ul>
										<li>Implenting a Game and Tick loop</li>
										<li>Introducing new methods for robotic pets</li>
										<li>Return a Collection of pets</li>
										<li>Constructors</li>
										<li>Introduce new attributes for the health of the pets</li>
										<li>Create new models for organic and robotic pets</li>
									</ul>

								<strong> <a href="https://github.com/MicaelaBerry/virtual-pet-shelter">Virtual Pet Shelter App</a></strong>

									<br></br>
									Time to volunteer at the pet shelter! With this multi-class app, you can add, adopt, feed, water, and play with all the pets inside. I used a pirate theme for my shelter so the pets could also pillage and sail the 7 seas. Arrrrrrgh! The IDE used for this project was Eclipse and the Java skills required were:
									<ul>
										<li>Implenting a Game and Tick loop</li>
										<li>Ask for user input</li>
										<li>Return a Collection of pets</li>
										<li>Constructors</li>
										<li>Add, remove pets from user input</li>
										<li>Instance Variables</li>
									</ul>
